<h1><center>About Me</center> </h1>
<p>The creator's name is <b><u>Clarence Jillian</u></b>. She is a <b>>special education teacher </b> who has a penchant for coding. She decided
  to take up a course on Udemy about coding because she wanted to create a working application for the center she is
  affiliated with.</p>

<p>She plans to create a working website for the center she is working. She decided to take it upon herself to
  accomplish this to make her and her clients' life easier. In terms of following their schedule and the tracking of
  absences and lates. Jillian wants to create this website application to create the center's online persona outside of
  facebook. She also wants to help the center's staff in tracking the client's payment.</p>

<p>She hopes to create this website to jumpstart her career in coding. She hopes that this will be her stepping stone
  into entering the IT industry as either a freelancer or as a web developer.</p>
